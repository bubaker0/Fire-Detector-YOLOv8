# Fire_Detector_V1
The first version of the project "Real-time Fire Detection Using Deep Neural Networks" was developed by Bobker Moussa Rafallah. The first goal of the project has been achieved, which is immediate fire detection with minimal errors and speed. Now, the second goal is to develop the project to support all devices, enabling immediate connection to the fire department and sending them the location of the fire along with images of the event in real time. If there is a critical situation, a command will be sent to the ambulance.
